# **Age and Gender detection :** 
 
> - ## **Objective :**
>       To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture 
>       using the deep learning
> - ## **About project :**
>       In this project , we will use deep learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single of image.
>       • We will trained model for this particular target.
>       • The predicted gender may be one of “male” and “female”, and the predicted age one of the following ranges- 
>         (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100)
>       • It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, 
>         obstructions, and facial expressions. 
>         And so, we make this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.

> - ## **Steps of project :**
>       • Detect the faces
>       • Classify into male /female
>       • Classify into one of the 8 age range
>       • Put the result on the image and displays it.
> - ## **The dataset :**
>       • For this project: the data set available in the public domain and you can find
>       • https://www.kaggle.com/ttungl/adience-benchmark-genderand-age-classification
>       • The face photos collected from various real world imaging condition like noise,lighting, pose and appearance.
>       • It has a total 26,580 photos of 2284 subject in eight age range.
>       • The model have be trained by this dataset only.
